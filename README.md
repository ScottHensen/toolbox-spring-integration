# Toolbox - Spring Integration

### *.siia.messageschannels packages  
These came right out of the Spring Integration in Action examples.  
These examples use Spring 3.  I made minor changes in order to use Spring 5, but did not convert
to strictly DSL.  All credit for the work should be given to the book's authors.
